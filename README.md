# Bluespec buffer bank

This is a synthesizable 8-element buffer bank written in Bluespec SystemVerilog
(BSV).  It’s a reasonable Bluespec ‘hello world’ example.

The included constraints file targets the [Digilent Nexys4] development board,
but you should be able to easily modify it to work with any FPGA.
